## Problem Statement: 
We plan to analyze COVID cases within the United States and globally over the past two years. Within the US the main categorization we would like to do is based on sorting via states, while globally we would sort by countries. We would like to search for common factors that can indicate greater levels of infection as well as responses to infection, such as vaccination and testing.
